1. Content
==========

This plugin is a small modification of the "Private Files" block of Moodle and lets your Java applets or Javascript
applications, created with Easy Java/Javascript Simulations (EJS) added to your Moodle course by means of the ejsapp
module, to store data files saved from these applets. It also includes a little AJAX feature that refreshes the files
block without refreshing the entire page.

The Java applets or the Javascript applications should have been created with version 5.1 (build 20150613 or later) of
EJS to work properly.
