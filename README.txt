EJSApp File Browser 1.0

This is the first release of the ejsapp_file_browser plugin.
This plugin is a small modification of the "Private Files" block of Moodle and lets your Java
applets, created with Easy Java Simulations (EJS) added to your Moodle course by means of the
ejsapp module, to store data files saved from.
The Java applets should be compiled with version 4.37 or older of EJS to properly work.

This is a block plugin for Moodle so you should place the ejsapp folder in your /blocks 
folder, inside you Moodle installation.

This block needs the ejsapp module to be of any use.
You can find and download the ejsapp module at the plugins section in the Moodle.org webpage.

An explanation of EJSApp is included in the folder "doc". You will also find a txt file with
relevant links.
